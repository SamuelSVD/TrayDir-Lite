		<h1>Instance Options</h1>
		<h2>Icon</h2>
		<p>The instance's icon can be changed. Doing so will change the icon that is used in the system tray. To do so, click on the Browse button to browse to any file whose icon you want TrayDir to use for this instance. All files are valid. I recommend downloading a <code>.ico</code> file from online and using that. It can help easily differentiate between instances in the system tray.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Run As Administrator
				<ul>
					<li>Always attempt to run items in this instance as administrator 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Show File Extensions
				<ul>
					<li>Show file extensions in the system tray menu items
					</li>
				</ul>

			<li>Open Folders in File Explorer When Clicked
				<ul>
					<li>Open File Explorer in the folder path specified when a folder item is clicked from the system tray menu
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Expand First Path
				<ul>
					<li>When only one item exists in the instance, and that item points to a folder, then the folder's contents will be used in the system tray menu instead.
