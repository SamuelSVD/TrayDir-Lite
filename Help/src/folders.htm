<h1>Folders</h1>
<p>Folders work as a link to a folder. By default the folder's contents can be explored from the system tray menu.<p>
<p>If a menu item is configured as a folder, the Use folder as shortcut option can be used to block the folder's contents from being displayed in the system tray menu.</p>
